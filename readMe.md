Real Dashboard is a global scipt based mod that adds the ability to use a scale inside the cabin of your tractor in FS22. 
Additionally it also changes the digital speedometers to show mph instead of kph if your game is set up for imperial units. 

Github version will always be the same version that is on the offical FS22 ModHub with the addition of the sdk included in the download.
Additionally the SDK is also available as a separate file on GitHub
